# Developer Setup

This repository contains all the scripts and instructions to set up a local dev environment and get started with the project.

## What

Folders:

1. [os-setup](01_os-setup):
    - Contains scripts and instructions to set up a local dev environment for specific OSs.
    - This is "_Optional_" if you already have a dev environment set up.

2. [bootstrap](02_bootstrap):
    - Contains scripts and instructions on how to clone and locally organize all repos in a comprehensive directory structure.

3. [conventions](03_conventions):
    - Contains documentation for the conventions and strategies used across the projects.

## Why

These set-up scripts and instructions allow for consistent setup and development across all interested systems and parties.

## How

The advice is to follow in order the content of the folders. They are numbered in the order of execution / reading.

If you already have a dev environment set up, you can skip the OS-specific set-up scripts. I would still recommend to browser the contents as to check if
everything I use, you also have it in some form or other.

With a dev environment set up, you can run the bootstrap scripts to clone and locally organize all repos and check conventions and so on.
