## General tools, config and tweaks for Linux OSs:

> **NOTE**:<br>
> Do not switch to unstable mirrors on any distro as they may make the OS less reliable and more prone to problems.<br>
> By the same token, do not run your system on experimental kernels.

### Tools and Tweaks

Given the different package managers, each OS file will have a Tools Section with the commands on how to install each recommended tool and a
Tweaks section for useful config.
