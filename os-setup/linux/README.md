# Other *nix Systems

## Maintaining more than one single only unique thing of anything is a no no

I know... I know...

I've stated somewhere else that supporting `N` variations of a `Y` thing is the worst for maintainability, and this is one exception to that approach.

As we may use different OSs and setups, I may provide in time different configuration guidelines for different platforms other than my own setup and
platform.

If I create them, I will not maintain them with the same rigor as my own platform.

## Why this actually is... _"One example why using `N` variations of a `Y` thing hurts a project maintainability."_

If there were 50 devs with 50 different setups...<br>
Onboarding, updates, questions would be just a nightmare.

What the hell, not everybody uses `OpenSuSE`.
